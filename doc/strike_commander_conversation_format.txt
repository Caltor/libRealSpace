Strike Commander Conversation Format :
======================================

By Fabien Sanglard
January 28st, 2014

Conversation are stored in GAMEFLOW.TRE under entry ..\\..\\DATA\\GAMEFLOW\\CONV.PAK
The data in there references images   from ..\\..\\DATA\\GAMEFLOW\\CONVSHPS.PAK
                             palettes from ..\\..\\DATA\\GAMEFLOW\\CONVPALS.PAK
                             char names to index are provided in ..\\..\\DATA\\GAMEFLOW\\CONVDATA.IFF


Conversation are formatted in two different format : 

For 1vs conversation a serie of opcode allow to define
who is taking, what is the background and what he/she is saying. Those are Close-Ups.


For Groups (or when the designers wanted to show that someone joined the conversation), the conversation
engine also allow to describe a full GROUP scene in tiny increment: Where it is happening then add 
characters. And then make then speak.

CONV.PAK contains 255 entries. Each is a full conversation. A conversation
is described via packets. A packet has a header and is followed by a payload.

A conversation can hence be fully played with the following pseudocode:

ReaderHeader(&header);
while (header != endOfPakEntry)
{
	payload = ReadPayload(header) ;
	ExecutePayload(payload)       ;
	ReaderHeader(&header)         ; 
}


Here are all the headers identified so far. They are enough to play all conversations in CONV.PAK.

#define GROUP_SHOT              0x00
#define GROUP_SHOT_ADD_CHARCTER 0x01
#define GROUP_SHOT_CHARCTR_TALK 0x02
#define CLOSEUP                 0x03
#define CLOSEUP_CONTINUATION    0x04
#define SHOW_TEXT               0x0A
#define YESNOCHOICE_BRANCH1     0x0B
#define YESNOCHOICE_BRANCH2     0x0C
#define UNKNOWN                 0x0E
#define CHOOSE_WINGMAN          0x0F
