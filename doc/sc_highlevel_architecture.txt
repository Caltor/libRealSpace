Strike Commander Executable System :
====================================

Strike Commande is not a monolitic DOS executable. Various 
aspects of the game are distributed over:

INSTALL.EXE	
MKTERR.EXE	
SC.EXE
MKGAME.EXE	
OPTTEST.EXE	
STRIKE.EXE

Each are discussed next, the size of each executable is given as a reverse
engineering time estimate (RETE). Based on prior experience, working evenings and
weekend on an EXE allows 10KB/month.

Installing the game from floppy disk to Hard-Drive is done via INSTALL.EXE
(7,793 bytes : RETE 2 weeks).

After installation, Strike commander is started from
calling C:\SC\SC.EXE

But SC.EXE is just a dispatch of 20KB (RETE: 1 month).

Upon calling it, it will load OPTTEST.EXE
which: 
   
    Play the intro.
    Display the various menu.
    Take care of the gameplay between missions.

OPTTEST.EXE is a much more significant EXE (870,528 bytes: RETE: 7 years)    

Upon starting a mission, OPTTEST.EXE verifiy
that the PAK file is ready. If not, it starts
MKTERR.EXE to generate it.
MKTERR.EXE is 203,744 bytes (RETE : 1.5 years).

Then it loads STRIKE.EXE: The actual 3D engine.
STRIKE.EXE 746,304 bytes (RETE: 6 years)

All those EXE are loaded with DOs 21h standard
system calls.

Note: I haven't figured out what MKGAME.EXE	 is used for
but it is (131,696 bytes : 1 year)

Total effort estimate for Strike Commander Reverse Engineering :


INSTALL.EXE	    7,793 bytes : RETE  2 weeks
MKTERR.EXE	  203,744 bytes : RETE  1.5 years
SC.EXE         20,000 bytes : RETE  1 month
MKGAME.EXE	  131,696 bytes : RETE  1 year
OPTTEST.EXE	  870,528 bytes : RETE  7 years
STRIKE.EXE    746,304 bytes : RETE  6 years
=============================================
15 years, 7 months and 2 weeks.

Now, we can assume that a lot of code is shared among executable (fixed point arithmetics, RLE encoding).
So we can probably reduce the estimate by 25% for a result of :

11 years.

Depressing.

Note: Why breakdown the EXEs ? 

 1. DOS RealMode only allowed for 1MB of RAM. A Big EXE would habe never fitted in memory.
 2. Multiple exes allowed multiple individual to work on the same project without interfering
 too much.
