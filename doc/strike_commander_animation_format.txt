Strike Commander animation are stored in layers. I am fairly sure they are organized like the SKF
from Ultima 8. The player (http://www.usecode.org/pentagram/doxygen/SKFPlayer_8cpp-source.html)
features evens to play sound, music, frame, subtitles and everything.

Animation layers format have been described by Matio in wc1g.txt.

Note that IFF palette colors are coded on 7 bits for JET
Note that IFF palette colors are coded on 8 bits for ANIMATIONS

Little is known about the rest so far.
